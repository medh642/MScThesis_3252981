1.	Motivation for Research
Insights derived from spatio-temporal analysis are important for effective decision making, policy formulation and improving public understanding (Starace and Di Martino, 2024). Effective decision-making in these domains i.e. disaster management, climate adaptation and environmental monitoring depends on the ability to reason about spatial and temporal information (Rahimi et al., 2025). Despite the growing availability of geospatial data and tools, potential users who wish to leverage these tools are unable to do so because they lack the technical expertise (Holm, 2024). This disconnect between the availability of tools and their practical application presents a challenge to inclusive and informed decision-making. 
A study by Naveen et al. (2023) highlights the challenges and missed opportunities accompanying geospatial data. For instance, it aids in urban planning, understanding and managing various environmental challenges, optimising transportation and improving mobility. However, interacting with such data requires specialised technical skills, domain-specific knowledge, and an understanding of data structures and spatial concepts (Naveen et al., 2023). Existing systems limit the effective usage of geospatial data in decision-making. They rely on traditional query languages with complex syntax, requiring users to frame precise queries. They often lack intuitive interfaces, making it difficult for non-experts to navigate them. Additionally, these systems do not often possess contextual awareness, limiting the depth of the analysis (Naveen et al., 2023).
Natural hazard resilience depends on spatio-temporal insights to optimise resource allocation and support planning aimed at reducing vulnerability and future risk. While a wide range of scientific methodologies exists, their complexity and the volume of information hinder translation of scientific knowledge to policies for risk mitigation (Xie et al., 2025). This issue is highlighted further by a difference in expertise and limited technical knowledge across stakeholders (Xie et al., 2025). One such example is brought out in a study by Martelo et al (2024), where they discuss how flood risk maps, which are aimed at improving preparedness and decision support, often fall short as they are not effectively utilised by non-experts. Addressing these gaps is necessary to democratise access to geospatial data for a broad range of users.
2.	Large Language Models (LLMs) for Geospatial Reasoning 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield within Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows machines to interpret, understand and generate human language (Vasdev, 2024). It provides a more familiar way of interacting with data. Through Natural Language queries, the system can understand the context and provide meaningful responses (Naveen et al., 2023). Advancements in AI and NLP, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), provide a solution for facilitating a broader range of users to utilise geospatial information for effective decision-making and other applications (Xie et al., 2025). LLMs are machine-learning models capable of comprehending and generating natural language through inherent patterns and relationships from massive amounts of text and data. In their study, Mansourian and Oucheikh (2024) list the various benefits of integrating LLMs with GIS; it promotes intuitive interaction, lowers the barrier to entry and encourages wider adoption across sectors. With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence, LLMs present a robust potential for intelligent task solving (Guo et al., 2024). In isolation, LLMs may not be capable of solving tasks; however, due to their extensive reasoning and understanding, they can be used effectively with external tools (Zhang et al., 2025). As a result, users can make more informed decisions. It also supports interdisciplinary collaboration by enabling diverse fields to integrate geospatial analysis into their workflows. 
LLMs, when properly enhanced, have the potential to improve accessibility, transparency and timeliness in geospatial reasoning tasks. Traditional approaches for geospatial analysis rely on rule-based systems or keyword-matching techniques, which were limited in their ability to handle complex spatial reasoning and context dependent reasoning (Wang et al., 2024). More recent systems have adopted NLP pipelines with discrete components, which still tend to operate in isolation, limiting spatial understanding (Naveen et al., 2023). This research proposes leveraging a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that dynamically retrieves geospatial data and allows LLMs to generate spatially grounded responses. Before delving into the details of this framework, it is necessary to examine the existing efforts in applying LLMs for geospatial analysis and identify the gaps that exist. 
3.	Limitations of Current LLMs in Spatial Analysis
Mooney et al. (2023), tested the foundation models (Open AI’s Generative Pretrained Transformer) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 through an introductory real-world based GIS exam, while the models performed well (scores of 63.3% and 88.3% respectively), they struggled with tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning, highlighting the requirement for domain-specific enhancements. Martelo et al. (2024) use GPT-4 to create an AI assistant for flood risk assessment. This tool uses a function-calling mechanism that integrates geospatial APIs and is capable of interpreting and responding to a broad range of flood-related questions, but does not involve retrieval-based augmentation. Similarly, Zhang et al.’s GeoGPT system integrated ChatGPT with GIS tools through a tool-augmented agent framework, which interprets user input and executes predefined spatial operations (e.g. buffer, intersect). Wagner et al. (2024) highlight the potential of LLMs to support EO analysis by extracting valuable insights from large, complex datasets. However, they also point out key limitations, such as the tendency of LLMs to produce verbose outputs and the constraints imposed by limited context windows. These systems demonstrate the potential of LLMs in spatial reasoning but rely on tool invocation rather than RAG. 
Yu et al.’s (2025) Spatial-RAG presents a dedicated RAG framework for geospatial reasoning. It introduces hybrid retrieval and joint spatial semantic ranking to ensure both geometric accuracy and contextual relevance. This could prove effective for disaster use cases where precise spatial referencing is critical. Wang et al.’s (2025) GeoRAG focuses of geospatial question answering, refining retrieval through task-specific classification and quality filtering to improve relevance and interpretability. Foundation models are restricted to the data they were trained on; it is computationally challenging and expensive to expand their knowledge base from scratch (Campo et al., 2025). While fine-tuning and tool-augmented systems can modify the model’s behaviour to perform desired tasks, it still falls short of expanding the model’s knowledge base. RAG provides a good alternative as it can inject external information without altering the base model, and it is also more suitable for dynamic systems by providing frequent information updates (Campo et al., 2025). It excels in scenarios where the application requires access to large domain-specific datasets or up-to-date, detailed information which may be absent in the LLM’s training data (NPi AI, 2025). Specifically in the case of disaster management, RAG is more suitable as it relies on synthesising large volumes of unstructured, domain-specific, and rapidly changing data (Xie et al., 2025).
Current LLMs may provide hasty and generic responses without developing context-specific responses, which may lead to misunderstandings or oversimplification (Xie et al., 2024). Through creating a tailored dataset and developing a RAG pipeline, a model can achieve higher factual accuracy in performing specific tasks. This can effectively address the challenge of LLM hallucination (Li et al., 2024). Standard LLMs also struggle to interpret complex grid-structured geospatial data, limiting their usefulness for location-specific risk assessment and infrastructure planning (Xie et al., 2025). A RAG-based approach can bridge this gap by dynamically integrating structured data and textual sources to generate grounded, evidence-based insights for decision-making. 
4.	Research Aim, Use Case and Contribution 
The overall aim of this research is to design and assess a RAG pipeline that leverages geospatial data sources to improve the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs. To achieve this aim, the following sub-objectives have been defined. 
I)	Exploring how geospatial data can be made machine-readable and retrievable 
RQ: What mechanism enables the transformation of geospatial data into formats that support machine-readability and efficient retrieval for LLMs?
II)	Designing and implementing different RAG pipelines
RQ: What impact do different RAG pipeline designs have on the integration of geospatial data with LLMs for spatial reasoning tasks?
III)	Comparison of general-purpose LLMs and LLMs supported through RAG
RQ: What are the differences in the qualitative and quantitative metrics that emerge between the two systems?
It intends to aid urban planners, policy professionals, the general public, and researchers who require access to spatial insights but may lack expertise in remote sensing and geospatial databases. To illustrate the potential of the proposed approach, this research uses flooding as a representative use case within disaster risk reduction; selected due to its high data complexity, societal relevance and existing gaps in decision support. While not the primary focus, this scenario provides a relevant context to evaluate the integration of LLMs with spatial and EO data for decision support for users from diverse fields. Though the prototype is demonstrated using flood-related spatial tasks, the approach can be generalised to other disaster mitigation contexts using EO data. 
To enhance spatial reasoning in LLMs using EO data, this research proposes an architecture based on a multi-agent framework. A “User Profile Agent” that collects contextual information such as user intent, location, and domain-specific requirements. A “Planning Agent” that identifies relevant EO datasets, social vulnerability indicators and scientific literature to be used. A “multi-objective ranking” layer that evaluates and ranks the retrieved output based on relevance. The final output is generated by an LLM-based generator (GPT-4), which converts spatial and textual inputs into natural language responses. A visualisation layer that renders spatial outputs to support user interpretation. This architecture builds on the methods demonstrated in the Spatial-RAG framework for spatial question answering by Yu et al. (2025) and on WildfireGPT, which uses a multi-agent system to coordinate retrieval and response generation for disaster response (Xie et al., 2025). 
A prototype will be implemented using Langchain and GPT, and its effectiveness will be evaluated using quantitative metrics (e.g. accuracy and F1 score) and expert review for spatial reasoning quality. While foundation models have been useful in rendering results, there are still limitations in their suitability for geospatial decision making. The system proposed by this study will be compared to general-purpose foundation models across a range of geospatial tasks to assess improvements in accuracy, reasoning quality and applicability (against benchmark responses for the prompts provided). Accordingly, this study is guided by a central research question: Does the use of RAG pipelines to retrieve geospatial information improve the spatial reasoning performance of LLMs in comparison to general-purpose models?
